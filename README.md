# AI & Network Traffic Performance

This repository contains code for a project focused on AI-based analysis and optimization of network traffic performance. The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to analyze network traffic data and improve network performance.

## Project Overview

- *Project Title*: AI & Network Traffic Performance
- *Objective*: To analyze and optimize network traffic using AI/ML models.
- *Dataset*: Network traffic data, stored on Google Drive (link provided below).
- *Tools Used*: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Google Colab

To run the code, you will need to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). The project is designed to be executed in a Colab environment, which provides a ready-to-use Python environment with access to GPUs/TPUs.

### 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project is given in the repo.Download this file and upload it in your Google drive. You can access the dataset using the following link:


Make sure to update the code to include the correct path to the dataset once it is added to your Google Drive.

### 3. Mounting Google Drive in Colab

To access the dataset stored in Google Drive, the Colab notebook should mount your Google Drive. Use the following code snippet in your Colab notebook to achieve this:

python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


After mounting, make sure to update the file paths to point to the correct location of the dataset in your Drive.

## How to Use

1. *Open the Notebook*: Click the link below to open the notebook in Google Colab.

   [Open in Colab]([<link_to_your_colab_notebook>](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fglfRo4jHL5giN1MOcIbl-IXdcMNINYP#scrollTo=1gJDh9Rzgje8))

2. *Mount Google Drive*: Run the code to mount Google Drive in your Colab session.

3. *Load the Dataset*: Update the file path to load the dataset from your Google Drive.

4. *Run the Code*: Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.

## Project Structure

- notebooks/: Contains the main Colab notebook for the project.
- scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- data/: Placeholder for data files (data is loaded from Google Drive).
- README.md: Project documentation.

## Results

Results of the AI-based network traffic analysis will be displayed in the notebook. This includes metrics like accuracy, latency, and network performance improvements.
